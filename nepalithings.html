                        managing events.

                        Interview findings revealed significant frustration among Event Organizers and Attendees due to

                        direct comparative feedback on the extent to which their previously identified needs and pain
                        points were addressed in the new design. The goal of this was to identify areas for refinement
                        and optimization based on user testing and feedback.
